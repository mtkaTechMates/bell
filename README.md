A live instance of this program is currently running at [bell.plus](https://bell.plus) (formerly [countdown.zone](https://countdown.zone) and [bell.lahs.club](https://bell.lahs.club)). This software continues to be developed by Los Altos High School alumni, [nicolaschan](https://github.com/nicolaschan) and [noloerino](https://github.com/noloerino), who began working on it during their senior year of high school. The [LAHS Hack Club](https://lahs.club) helps to maintain the schedules for LAHS.
